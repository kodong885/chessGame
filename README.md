# chessGame
## Purpose
THis project is made for practicing my java grammer, especially focusing on "interface", "overriding".

## a superficial plan before building this application
1. I show the chess board to user by print(System.out.PrintIn(~~~~)).
2. Every each turn, each user select chess piece, and decide where to move.

## the Architecture 
- main
  * chessGameApplication.java // set initial setting
  * console.java // print the chess board and get user's input.
- domain
  * chessPiece.java // setX(), setY(),
  * checkCapturePiece.java // depending on the piece what user now uses...
- service
  * // set later hahahhhhhhhhh
- infrastructure
  * chessPieces // user interface here.. maybe..?


I will add more plan here building this project !
